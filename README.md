# ironhack DATA ANALYSIS Jan2022

- Members of the group: Odelia Ahdout, Adriana Cuppuleri, Alejandra Parra,
- Goal of the project: Our aim is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset (e.g., area, number of rooms, etc.). One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above. 
- Data: The data set consists of information on some 22,000 properties sold in King County (including Seattle) between May 2014 to May 2015.
- Brief description of the dataset: 
  - source: data set provided by teaching team DA, Ironhack
  - no. rows: 21,597
  - no.features: 21 
- High-level Planning of the project:
  - Day 1: Data Exploration (data visualization, descriptive statistics, distinction between numerical and categorical variable, checking null              values).
  - Day 2: Data Cleaning (renaming, lower_case, removing duplicate rows and uninformative columns, handling missing values).
           Data Transformation (scale numerical features, encode categorical features, handling outliers).
  - Day 3: Creating a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables. Checking the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices).
  - Day 4: Presenting yourfinding with data visualization tools.
